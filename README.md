eSCIMo
======

eSCIMo is a Java-based implementation of the SCIM v2.0 specification (see the
references section at the endo of this document).  This project was cloned from
the [Apache Directory Subversion repository](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/directory/escimo/trunk/)
and is intended as an experimental project looking at whether the untyped eSCIMo
project and typed [Igloo](https://github.com/PennState/igloo) projects can be
merged.

Warning
-------

While this project may be have changes to the original Subversion repository
merged into it from time-to-time, there should be no expectation that the
contents of this project will ever be merged back into the eSCIMo source code.
Please don't submit pull requests to this project.
